## What is considered political content?

Some may argue that open source itself is strongly tied to politics.
That's true, but it does not mean that it's correct to post arbitrary political content.

So we filter political contents which ...

- ... is posted in open source world.

    e.g. at GitHub, on official websites

- ... is not directly related to open source or people involved in open source

    Some may argue that a few core team members are blah blah blah.
    But the "announcement" should make it clear that they are just helping those developers, not taking any stand.
